# Jim's Ultimate Farro Salad

Adapted from the awesome salad at Fancy Hank's

## Ingredients

#### For the Salad:

- 2 cups farro
- 3/4 cup slivered almonds
- 2 large zucchini, diced 1/2- or 3/4-inch thick
- 1/2 cup mint, chopped
- 1/4 red onion, diced
- 1 cup feta cheese, crumbled
- 4 1/2 cups water
- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- Salt and pepper to taste

#### For the Vinaigrette:

- 3/4 cup good quality olive oil
- Zest and juice of 1 large lemon
- 2 1/2 tablespoons grainy mustard
- 1 1/2 teaspoon salt

## Method

1. Place the water and the farro in a medium sized saucepan. Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer until the farro is tender (about 30 minutes).
2. Drain the farro well, and then allow it to cool in a large mixing bowl. You may add a drizzle of olive oil to prevent it from clumping as it cools.
3. While the farro is cooling, place the almonds in a small saucepan over a medium heat. Stir until golden brown, then remove from the pan to cool.
4. Make the vinegarette by mixing all ingedients together.
5. Once both the farro and almonds are cool, place in a large salad bowl. Add the zucchini, mint and feta.
6. Just prior to serving, cover the ingredients with the vinegarette, and toss through gently to coat.
