# Tingly Rib Rub

## Ingredients

- 3 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 heaped tbsp coffee beans, ground
- 1 tbsp cumin seed
- 1 tbsp coriander seed
- 1 tbsp fennel seed
- 1/2 tsp ancho chilli powder
- 1/2 tsp chipotle chilli powder
- 1/2 tsp cayenne chilli powder
- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes

## Method

Add ingredients to a mortar and pestle, and grind until you get the consistency you want [^1].

[^1]: I like to keep my rubs fairly coarse to create more of an interesting bark, I just break up the seeds enough so they don't stick in your teeth.
