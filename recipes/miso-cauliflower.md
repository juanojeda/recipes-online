Preheat your grill coals.

Cook some plain rice in a rice cooker, short grain if you have it.

Prepare your quick pickle:
Chop up the lettuce finely.
slice your carrot and radish in angled slices, about 1/2 cm thick.
mix the water, sugar and vinegar together until the sugar dissolves.
Add your vegetables, and dill if you're using it.
Set aside until plating.

Prepare the cauli:
Heat some butter in a pot on a medium heat, gently sizzle some whole garlic cloves until fragrant.
Add the whole cauliflower, stalk down and fry for about 5 minutes, until there's a bit of colour on the stalk.
add half a cup of water to the pot, then cover. Cook until the cauliflower is tender - knife tip slides in about 1-2 cm.
Remove from the heat and leave it covered while you make the glaze.

Prepare the glaze:
Mix all ingredients except the sesame oil in a bowl in a bowl until all combined.
Reduce over a low heat until the alcohol has evaporated, and it is rapidly bubbling. It should be the consistency of watery ketchup.
Add the sesame oil and whisk through.

Drain the cauliflower. From the crown, cut the cauliflower in quarters, but not all the way through. You just want to expose the inside for the glaze.
Using about half the glaze, cover the cauliflower all over, covering as much as you can. Get some glaze on the leaves too, as they'll charr up nicely.
Reserve the other half.

Place your cauliflower on the grill, starting with the leaves side down. Baste with the glaze every 5 or so minutes with the other half of the glaze, and turn the cauliflower when charr marks start to form.
As the cauliflower is already steamed, you're just trying to impart a smokey and charred flavour.
When it's done, remove from the heat and set aside.

Prepare the caramel:
Mix all ingredients except the butter and sesame oil in a bowl in a bowl until all combined.
heat in a small pot over a low heat until it's simmering. Continue to reduce until a caramel starts to form. Stir frequently so the sugar doesn't burn.
When the alcohol has evaporated and the caramel has reached a thick, syrupy consistency, remove from the heat and add in the butter and sesame oil, stirring it through.

In a bowl, toss the lettuce with a bit of olive oil, a tbsp of the pickling liquid, and the lemon juice.

Plating
The pickles on a bed of the dressed lettuce.
A quarter of the cauliflower, drizzled with the caramel.
A 1 cup mound of rice.
