  3. While continuing to beat the eggs, begin to add the oil in a slow, thin stream.
  4. When the mayonnaise begins to reach a thick consistency with soft peaks, slowly add the lime juice until you reach a thin mayonnaise consistency.
  5. Add the garlic, coriander and seasoning, and pulse until well combined.
  6. Add dressing to base ingredients, one tablespoon at a time, and combine until you reach the desired coverage.
  If the coleslaw is a bit clumpy, add a bit more lime juice and oil, and season to taste.
