# Coleslaw

Serves 4-6

## Ingredients

#### Base
- 3 cups red and green cabbage, chopped like coleslaw
- 1 cup carrot, shredded
- 1 green apple, shredded or chopped finely
- 1/2 cup spring onion, chopped finely
- 1 red chili, chopped finely *(I like Bird's Eye chili, but a Thai red, or 1/2 long red would also work)*

#### Mayonnaise dressing
*You __could__ use a store-bought mayonnaise, but you'd be doing it wrong...*
- 1 egg, whole
- 1 egg yolk
- approx. 3/4 cup of good oil *(I prefer EVOO, but you can use a lighter-flavoured oil) [^1]
- Juice of 1 1/2 limes
- 2-4 cloves of garlic, chopped finely *(depending on how garlicky you like it)*
- 1/2 cup coriander, chopped roughly
- Salt, to taste


## Method

1. Combine the base salad ingredients in a bowl, and mix roughly.
2. Beat the eggs with a stick mixer, hand mixer or food processor until well combined, approx. 2 mins.
3. While continuing to beat the eggs, begin to add the oil in a slow, thin stream.
4. When the mayonnaise begins to reach a thick consistency with soft peaks, slowly add the lime juice until you reach a thin mayonnaise consistency.
5. Add the garlic, coriander and seasoning, and pulse until well combined.
6. Add dressing to base ingredients, one tablespoon at a time, and combine until you reach the desired coverage.
If the coleslaw is a bit clumpy, add a bit more lime juice and oil, and season to taste. 

[^1]: This is a guesstimation; you may need to adjust the oil amount.
